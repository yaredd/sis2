Her most recent writing on Napoleon was completed at standard and turned in on time. This is significant progress. However, Bethel continues to be sometimes disorganized and does not complete all assignments on time. My suggestions for Bethel are:\r\n1. Use only one computer all of the time. If she does any work on another computer, it is likely to be lost or not properly transferred over, which ends up being a waste of time. \r\n2. Pack her bag before going to bed to make sure she has the correct binders, notebooks and laptop ready to go when she wakes up in the morning. \r\n3. Continue to work on her writing. She needs to pay special attention to making her sentences short to avoid writing run ons. Also, she should continue to use the transition words that we discussed in class in order to help organize her writing.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please contact me,\r\n\r\nBrian Greenough\r\nBrian.Greenough@icsaddis.edu.et \r\n0913-026-646','2011-11-18 06:50:15','2011-11-18 06:50:15');
